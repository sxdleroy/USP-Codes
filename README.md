# USP Codes  
Welcome to **USP Codes** ‚Äì my digital treasure chest of coding adventures from my Bachelor‚Äôs journey at the University of S√£o Paulo! This repo is where I stash the scripts, projects, and snippets I‚Äôve crafted while exploring the wild world of computer science. Think of it as a living portfolio of my academic quests, from late-night debugging to triumphant "it works!" moments.

## What‚Äôs Inside?  
This repository is a collection of code from my USP courses ‚Äì everything from algorithms to data structures, maybe a little Python spice, or some C++ grit. Each folder or file here tells a story of a problem tackled, a concept grasped, or a deadline narrowly escaped. It‚Äôs not just about the solutions; it‚Äôs about the journey of learning through trial, error, and coffee.

### Highlights  
- **Coursework Classics**: Assignments and projects straight from the lecture halls of USP.  
- **Language Medley**: Expect a mix of Python, Java, C, or whatever the professors threw my way.  
- **Organized Chaos**: Folders named by course, semester, or sheer vibes ‚Äì I‚Äôll figure it out as I go.  

## Why This Exists  
- To **document my growth** as a coder and student.  
- To **share knowledge** with fellow learners (or future me when I forget how I solved that one problem).  
- To prove to my mom that those long nights at the keyboard were worth it.  

## How to Navigate  
- Dive into any folder that catches your eye ‚Äì they‚Äôre (mostly) self-explanatory.  
- Check out the code, run it if you dare, and feel free to laugh at my early attempts.  
- Each project might have its own mini-README or comments if I was feeling extra helpful that day.  

## Getting Started  
Want to poke around? Clone this repo and explore:  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/USP-Codes.git  
cd USP-Codes  
```  
Some projects might need specific dependencies ‚Äì I‚Äôll try to note those where I remember. Otherwise, assume Python 3.x, a standard compiler, and a sprinkle of optimism.

## Contributions  
This is my personal sandbox, so I‚Äôm not taking pull requests (yet!). But if you‚Äôve got tips, feedback, or just want to geek out about USP life, hit me up via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/[YourUsername]/USP-Codes/issues) or wherever I‚Äôve left my digital footprint.

## Fun Fact  
The green squares on my GitHub graph? Fueled by equal parts determination and desperation before deadlines. Stick around to watch them grow as I survive each semester!

## License  
This code is shared for learning and inspiration. Feel free to borrow ideas, but if you‚Äôre submitting these to your own USP profs, let‚Äôs just say I‚Äôve already claimed the originality points. üòâ No formal license yet ‚Äì it‚Äôs a student‚Äôs honor code for now.
